this is a basic template to get started with phaser, cordova in typescript.

to get started :

npm install
typings install

then run 'gulp' for live reload on the project.

you can use cordova from the root directory for the all device related commands.

place all your code in the 'game' folder for it to compile and all assets from res/release/ will get added to the  /build/assets folder for use in the game.

its a very early project so issues are to be expected.

let me know of any issues or comments you have.
